This is the project for course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwDQt7s1o9J7xm2MFwUO1yG0VRVyWy-lY

Note that:
1. The code covers all the demonstrations shown in the course, but is organized in a different structure.
2. The project is developed in Java 11.
3. Instead of MySQL, in-file H2 database is employed in this project. Some functions are slightly different from the course as a result.
4. Since I do not have the data in the course demonstrations, some changes are made to this project to bypass the usage of those data.
